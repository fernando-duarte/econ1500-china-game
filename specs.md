## Professor Dashboard
- Real-time leaderboard displaying:
  - GDP ranking
  - Net exports ranking
  - Balanced economy ranking
- Charts tracking overall class performance
- Controls explicitly provided to start subsequent rounds
- Capability to pause or restart the timer

## Technical Setup
- Students must connect to provided Wi-Fi.
- Each group selects exactly one leader device for decision submissions.
- All students may individually view progress but submissions are allowed only via the leader device.

## Comprehensive Economic Model

### Endogenous Variables
- GDP (Y)
- Capital Stock (K)
- Human Capital (H)
- Productivity (Total Factor Productivity, TFP, A)
- Net Exports (NX)
- Consumption (C)
- Investment (I)

### Exogenous Variables
- Labor Force Growth (n)
- Foreign Income Growth
- Domestic Interest Rate
- Foreign Interest Rate
- Openness Ratio
- FDI Ratio

### Student-Determined Variables (Exogenous, set by students each round)
- **Savings Rate (s)**: Chosen explicitly by students, no fixed default (initial suggested default at 10%)
- **Exchange Rate (e)**: Determined by students' choice each round:
  - Undervalue: 20% lower than the market baseline
  - Market-Based: Baseline market exchange rate
  - Overvalue: 20% higher than the market baseline

### Model Equations (Explicitly Defined)
- **Production**: \(Y(t) = A(t) \times K(t)^\alpha \times (L(t) \times H(t))^{(1-\alpha)}\)
- **Capital Accumulation**: \(K(t+1) = (1 - \delta) \times K(t) + s \times Y(t) + NX(t)\)
- **Labor Force Growth**: \(L(t+1) = L(t) \times (1+n)\)
- **Human Capital Growth**: \(H(t+1) = H(t) \times (1+\eta)\)
- **Productivity Growth**: \(A(t+1) = A(t) \times (1 + g + \theta \times openness\_ratio + \phi \times fdi\_ratio)\)
- **Net Exports**: \(NX(t) = \beta \times (domestic\_interest\_rate - foreign\_interest\_rate)\)

### Explicit Parameters
- \(\alpha = 0.3\)
- \(\delta = 0.1\)
- \(g = 0.005\)
- \(\theta = 0.1453\)
- \(\phi = 0.1\)
- \(\beta = -90\)
- \(n = 0.00717\)
- \(\eta = 0.02\)

### Explicit Exogenous Variables
- Foreign income growth: 3% per year.
- Domestic interest rate: 4% annually.
- Foreign interest rate: 8% annually.
- Openness ratio: starts at 0.1 and increases gradually.
- FDI ratio (post-1990): 0.02.

## Step-by-Step Computation (Explicitly Detailed)
- Each Round:
  1. Input current GDP, capital stock, labor force, human capital, and productivity values.
  2. Apply student-selected savings rate and exchange rate explicitly.
  3. Compute GDP explicitly using the production equation.
  4. Update capital stock explicitly with capital accumulation equation.
  5. Update labor force explicitly.
  6. Update human capital explicitly.
  7. Update productivity explicitly.
  8. Compute net exports explicitly.

## Prize Determination (Explicit Criteria)
- **Highest GDP Growth**: Highest GDP value in the final round.
- **Highest Net Exports**: Highest Net Export value in the final round.
- **Best Balanced Economy**: Highest combined GDP and consumption in the final round.
